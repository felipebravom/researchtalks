\section{Introduction}


\begin{frame}{Disclaimer}

 This talk is heavily based on this book!

\begin{frame}{Social Media}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Microblogging services are increasingly being adopted by people in order to access and publish information.  
 \item \textbf{Twitter}: Massively used Microblogging platform where users post messages limited to 140 characters referred to as \textbf{tweets}. 
 \item  Tweets can be used to convey  emotions,  opinions, and  stance.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Sentiment Analysis and Social Media}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Opinions are provided \textbf{freely and voluntarily} by the users in Twitter. 
 \item Analysing the sentiment underlying these opinions has important applications in product \textbf{marketing} and \textbf{politics}.
 
   \begin{figure}[h]

        \end{figure}
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}




\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis}
\begin{scriptsize}\begin{itemize}
 \item Application of \textbf{NLP} and \textbf{text mining} techniques to identify and extract subjective information from textual datasets.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Main Problem: Message-level Polarity Classification (MPC)}
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Automatically classify a tweet to classes \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{\textbf{positive}}, \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{negative}}, or \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,1.00,0.00}{\textbf{neutral}}. 
   
     \begin{figure}[h]
        	\includegraphics[scale = 0.15]{pics/sent.png}
        \end{figure}
   
   \item State-of-the-art solutions use \textbf{supervised} machine learning models trained from \textbf{manually} annotated examples \cite{Mohammad2013}.
  \end{enumerate} 
\end{block}

\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other Tasks}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Stance Detection: detect if the author of a tweet is in favor, against or neutral regarding a give target (e.g., Donald Trump). 
   \item Irony/Sarcasm Detection: detecting sarcasm in tweets.
   \item Emotions classification: classify tweets according to multiple emotions (e.g., anger, fear, sadness, joy)
   \item  Infer emotion intensities (numerical values) in tweets (e.g., degree of anger).
   \item Affective\footnote{We will use the term ``\textbf{affect}'' to encompass sentiment, emotions, and other related concepts.} Lexicon Induction: classification of words into affective dimensions. 

\item Many of these tasks have been evaluated as part of \textbf{SemEval}.

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Drawbacks of Supervised models}
\begin{scriptsize}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Label sparsity (LS)}: manual annotation is \textbf{labour-intensive} and \textbf{time-consuming}. 
   \item \textbf{Concept drift}: the sentiment pattern can vary from one collection to another (domain-drift, temporal-drift).
 
 \item A classifier trained from tweets annotated for one domain will \textbf{not necessarily} work on another one! 
\item Trained models can become outdated over time.
  \end{itemize} 



\begin{block}{Examples of domain-Drift}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  For me the queue was pretty \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{\textbf{small}} and it was only a 20 minute wait I think but was so worth it!!! :D @raynwise
\item Odd spatiality in Stuttgart. Hotel room is so  \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{small}} I can barely turn around but surroundings are inhumanly vast \& long under construction.
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}


\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Label Sparsity}
\begin{scriptsize}

\begin{itemize}
\item A possible approach to \textbf{overcome} the sentiment-drift problem is to 
\textbf{constantly update} the sentiment classifier with \textbf{recent labelled data} \cite{bifet2010, Silva2011}.

\item The high arrival rates of social streams make the continuous acquirement of sentiment labels \textbf{infeasible} \cite{Silva2011, calais2011bias,Guerra2014}. 
\end{itemize}

\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Approaches to overcome label sparsity}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{block}{Distant Supervision}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Automatically \textbf{label} unlabelled data (\textbf{Twitter API}) using a heuristic method.
   \item \textbf{Emoticon-Annotation Approach (EAA)}: tweets with positive \textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{\textbf{:)}} or negative \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{:(}} emoticons are labelled according to the polarity indicated by the emoticon~\cite{Read2005}.
  \item The emoticon is \textbf{removed} from the content.
  \item The same approach has been extended to Hashtags \#anger, and emojis.
\item Drawback: emoticons can induce noisy and incomplete information. Moreover they are not necessarily used in all domains (e.g., politics). 
\end{itemize} 
 
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Crowdsourcing}
  \begin{itemize}
\item Rely on services like \textbf{Amazon Mechanical Turk} or \textbf{Crowdflower} to ask the \textbf{crowds} to label a sample of the data on a demand-driven basis.
\item This can be expensive for online sentiment analysis (label sparsity problem). 
   \end{itemize} 
 
\end{block}

\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Roadmap}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this talk we will overview various approaches tackling the main sentiment analysis problems.
\item We will also introduce modern concepts in natural language processing based on \textbf{neural networks} such as \textbf{word embeddings}, \textbf{convolutional neural networks} (CNNs), and \textbf{Long short-term memory networks} (LSTMs).
\end{itemize} 

\end{scriptsize}

\section{Other Neural Network Architectures}


\begin{frame}{Recursive Neural Networks over Sentiment Treebank}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item A recursive neural tensor network for learning the sentiment of pieces of texts of different granularities, such as words, phrases, and sentences, was proposed in~\cite{socher2013recursive}.
\item The network was trained on a sentiment annotated treebank \url{http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html} of parsed sentences for learning compositional vectors of words and phrases.
\item Every node in the parse tree receives a vector, and there is a matrix capturing how the meaning of adjacent nodes changes. 
\item The network is trained using a variation of backpropagation called Backprop through Structure.
\item The main drawback of this model is that it relies on parsing.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Paragraph vector}
% See dissapointment slide http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2015_manning_deep_learning/
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item A paragraph vector-embedding model that learns vectors for sequences of words of arbitrary length (e.g, sentences, paragraphs, or documents) without relying on parsing was proposed in~\cite{LeM14}. 
\item The paragraph vectors are obtained by training a similar network as the one used for training the CBOW embeddings. 
\item The words surrounding a centre word in a window are used as input together with a paragraph-level vector for predict the centre word. 
\item The paragraph-vector acts as a memory token that is used for all the centre words in the paragraph during the training the phase. 
\item The recursive neural tensor network and the paragraph-vector embedding were evaluated on the same movie review dataset used in \cite{Pang2002}, obtaining an accuracy of 85.4\% and 87.8\%, respectively. 
\item Both models outperformed the results obtained by classifiers trained on representations based on bag-of-words features.
\item Many researchers have have  struggled  to  reproduce these paragraph vectors \cite{lau2016empirical}.

\begin{frame}{Summary}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  WASSA 2017 Shared Task in Emotion Intensity: given a tweet an emotion X (anger, fear, joy, or sadness) determine the intensity or degree of emotion X felt by the speakerâa real-valued score between 0 and 1. 
\item English tweets were annotated using Best-Worst scaling.
\item Twenty-two teams participated.  Best system: ensemble of deep learning models (r = 0.74).
\item SemEval 2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets. Extension of previous task including VAD emotions and two more languages: Spanish and Arabic.
\item AffectiveTweets Weka Package
